# Ravenous Project by Codecademy

## Ravenous Part 1: Creating Project & Components
Welcome to the Ravenous project, where you’ll be building a restaurant recommendation website that allows users to search for local businesses based on their location and keywords. Using a tech stack that includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and the Yelp API, you’ll be creating an application that replicates the core functionality of Yelp. If you want to get a feel for what Ravenous can be, visit the Yelp website and search for restaurants in your area.

In this first part of a four-part project, you will lay the foundations of Ravenous by building the website’s homepage. By the end, you will have created a static interface for Ravenous, which features a header, a search bar, and a list of businesses.

Through the four parts of Ravenous, you’ll build upon this foundation, adding features such as sorting and filtering options, and dynamic search results. By the end of the project, you’ll have developed a fully functional restaurant recommendation website that will help users find their next favorite eatery.

## Project Requirements
Build the restaurant recommendation application using React
Utilize HTML, CSS, and Javascript as part of the tech stack
Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub
Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project, including:
The purpose of your project
Technologies used
Features
Future work

## Features

The website allows users to scroll up and down to navigate through its content.
Users can simulate a search by typing in the search bar
A list of mock restaurant data is presented to the user.

## Prerequisites

HTML
CSS
Javascript
React
Git and GitHub
HTTP Requests and Responses

## React app
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
